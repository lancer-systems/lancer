description: What you need before installing Lancer
---

Before installing Lancer, make sure you have the following:

## Node.js 22+

Lancer requires Node.js 22 or later. Check your version:

```bash
node --version
```

If you need to install or update Node.js, visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Cloud Provider Account

Currently, Lancer supports **AWS**. You need an AWS account with:

- **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** with administrator permissions
- Or an **AWS CLI profile** configured with appropriate permissions

### Creating AWS Credentials

1. Go to the [AWS IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)
2. Navigate to **Users** → **Create user**
3. Give the user a name (e.g., `lancer-admin`)
4. Attach the **AdministratorAccess** policy
5. Create an access key under **Security credentials**

Keep your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key safe. You'll need them during installation.

## Pulumi (Optional)

Lancer uses Pulumi to manage infrastructure. The installer will automatically install Pulumi if it's not already present.

If you prefer to install it manually:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com | sh
```

## Cost Estimate (AWS)

Running Lancer on AWS will cost approximately **$19/month**:

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Foundation (VPC, ALB, ECS Cluster) | ~$16/month |
| Lancer API (t4g.nano EC2, ARM) | ~$3/month |
| **Total** | **~$19/month** |

This is the base cost. Additional services you deploy will incur extra charges.
