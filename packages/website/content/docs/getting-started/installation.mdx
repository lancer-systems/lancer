## Quick Install

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.lancer.run | bash
```

## Installation Steps

The installer will guide you through the following steps:

### 1. Cloud Provider Credentials

Choose how to provide your credentials. For AWS:

- **AWS CLI Profile**: Select from your configured profiles
- **Manual Entry**: Enter Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and region

The installer validates your credentials before proceeding.

### 2. Admin Account

Create your admin account:

- **Email**: Your login email
- **Password**: At least 8 characters

### 3. Cost Confirmation

Review the estimated monthly cost and confirm to proceed.

### 4. Deployment

The installer will:

1. Create a state storage bucket
2. Deploy the foundation infrastructure
3. Deploy the Lancer API
4. Wait for the API to become healthy
5. Create your admin account

This typically takes 5-10 minutes.

### 5. Success

Once complete, you'll see:

```
✓ Lancer is ready!

  URL: http://your-lancer-instance.example.com
  Admin: your@email.com

Happy deploying!
```

## Dry Run Mode

```
