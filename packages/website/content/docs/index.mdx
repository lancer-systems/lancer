Lancer is a self-hosted deployment platform that lets you deploy web services, databases, and caches on your own cloud provider.

## Why Lancer?

**Self-Hosted**: Your infrastructure, your data. No vendor lock-in. Full control over your stack.

**Simple Deployment**: One command to install. Connect your repositories and deploy through a dashboard.

**Cost Efficient**: Run on your own cloud provider. No platform markup. Pay only for the resources you use.

## How It Works

Lancer deploys a lightweight API and dashboard to your cloud provider. From there, you can deploy your applications through a web interface.

1. **Install**: Run the installer to set up Lancer on your cloud provider
2. **Login**: Access your dashboard with admin credentials
3. **Deploy**: Connect your repositories and deploy

## Supported Providers

Currently, Lancer supports **AWS** as a cloud provider. Support for additional providers is planned.
