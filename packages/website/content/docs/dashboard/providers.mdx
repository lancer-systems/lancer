Providers store the credentials Lancer uses to deploy resources to your cloud accounts.

## Default Provider

During installation, Lancer creates a default provider using the credentials you provided. This provider is used for all deployments unless you specify otherwise.

## Supported Providers

Currently, Lancer supports:

- **AWS**: Amazon Web Services

## Adding a Provider

To add a new provider:

1. Navigate to **Providers** in the dashboard
2. Click **Add Provider**
3. Select the provider type (e.g., AWS)
4. Fill in the required credentials
5. Click **Create**

Lancer validates your credentials before saving.

### AWS Provider Configuration

For AWS providers, you'll need:

- **Name**: A unique identifier (lowercase, alphanumeric, hyphens allowed)
- **Region**: The AWS region for deployments
- **Access Key ID**: Your AWS access key
- **Secret Access Key**: Your AWS secret key

## Provider Security

- Credentials are stored encrypted in the database
- Access keys are never displayed after creation
- Each provider is isolated to its cloud account

## Best Practices

- Use dedicated IAM users with limited permissions for each provider
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use separate providers for different environments (staging, production)
