Lancer is designed to be cost-effective. Here's a breakdown of expected costs for AWS.

## AWS Base Infrastructure

These costs apply as soon as you install Lancer:

| Component | Description | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| ALB | Application Load Balancer | ~$16 |
| Lancer API | t4g.nano EC2 instance (ARM) | ~$3 |
| **Total Base** | | **~$19/month** |

## Cost Savings

Lancer uses several strategies to reduce costs:

1. **No NAT Gateway**: Saves ~$32/month by using public subnets
2. **Shared ALB**: One load balancer for all services
3. **ARM instances**: Graviton instances are ~20% cheaper than x86
4. **Right-sized instances**: Start small and scale as needed

## AWS Free Tier

The ALB costs (~$16/month) still apply even during the AWS Free Tier period. The t4g.nano instance is not covered by Free Tier but is very cost-effective at ~$3/month.
