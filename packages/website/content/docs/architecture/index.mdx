description: How Lancer works under the hood
---

Lancer deploys a lightweight infrastructure to your cloud provider that manages your applications.

## Overview

Lancer consists of:

- **Foundation**: Shared infrastructure (networking, load balancing, container orchestration)
- **Lancer API**: The dashboard and API that manages deployments

## AWS Architecture

When using AWS as a cloud provider:

### Foundation Infrastructure

- **VPC**: Virtual Private Cloud with 2 public subnets
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Routes traffic to your services
- **ECS Cluster**: Manages container orchestration
- **IAM Roles**: Permissions for ECS instances

### Lancer API

The API runs as an ECS service and provides:

- Dashboard web interface
- REST API for deployments
- Authentication and user management

## Design Principles

### Cost Optimization

Lancer is designed to minimize cloud costs:

- **No NAT Gateway**: Uses public subnets only
- **Shared Load Balancer**: One load balancer for all services
- **ECS on EC2**: More cost-effective than Fargate for small workloads
- **ARM instances**: Uses Graviton (t4g) instances where available

### Security

- All traffic routed through load balancer with HTTPS support
- Security groups isolate services
- Database credentials stored encrypted
- EBS volumes encrypted at rest
